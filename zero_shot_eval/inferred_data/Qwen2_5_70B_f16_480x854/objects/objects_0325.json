        "output": "(D) trowel  \n(F) float  \n\nThe hands in the video are using a tool to smooth out plaster on a wall. The tool appears to be a trowel or a float, which are commonly used for this purpose. The surface being worked on has a rough texture typical of freshly applied plaster, and the tool is being moved across it to achieve a smoother finish. There is no indication of a brush, spatula, bucket, or paint can being used in the video."
