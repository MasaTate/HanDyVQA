        "output": "(B) clay blocks  \n(F) mud molder  \n\nThe hands in the video are seen using a mud molder to shape clay blocks. The person picks up the molder and places it on the ground, then uses their hand to gather and place clay into the molder. After shaping the clay, they lift the molder to reveal the newly formed clay block. Therefore, both the clay blocks and the mud molder are directly interacted with by the hands."
