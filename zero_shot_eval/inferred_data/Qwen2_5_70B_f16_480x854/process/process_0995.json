    "question": "How does the person turn the piston rotor with the ring spanner in his gloved right hand?",
    "options": [
        "The person holds the ring spanner somewhat loosely in his gloved right hand, positions it at a less optimal angle, and applies pressure quickly, making it challenging to turn the rotor effectively.",
        "The person firmly grips the ring spanner in his gloved right hand, positions it securely around the piston rotor's bolt, and applies steady pressure, turning it smoothly to rotate the rotor into position.",
        "The person pinches the ring spanner slightly between their fingers in the gloved right hand, tries to push against the piston rotor with less alignment, making it prone to slipping.",
        "The person uses mostly their wrist to twist the ring spanner in their gloved right hand, resulting in less controlled movements and challenges in achieving a smooth rotation of the piston rotor.",
        "The person balances the ring spanner gently on the edge of the piston rotor with his gloved right hand, relying mostly on its weight to turn rather than consistent manual pressure."
